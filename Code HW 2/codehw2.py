# Here, button_b stands in for the force sensitive
# resistor and an LED stands in for the full
# undeveloped circuit. This will show that:
#
# 1. While button_b (or force sensitive resistor -
#    FSR) is depressed AND a specified temperature is
#    not exceeded (here, 31ยบ C), the circuit is closed
#    and the LED light (or heating current) on.
#
# 2. While the circuit is closed, if the temperature
#    does go above range, the current will
#    automatically shut off.
#
# 3. Items 1 and 2 are looped, switching the
#    circuit from open to closed as needed according
#    to continuous temperature readings. If the
#    temperature reading already exceeds the
#    prescribed range while button_b is pressed,
#    this loop will not begin.
#
# 4. While button_b (or force sensitive resistor -
#    FSR) is not depressed, the circuit remains closed.
#
#
# TO TEST THE CODE
#
# The temperature of 31ยบ C was chosen to easily
# test the code based on the room temperature of my
# apartment. To test the code easily in other
# environments, this may need to be adjusted.
#
# Pressing and holding down Button B on the
# micro:bit while applying heat to the temperature
# sensor on the opposite side of the micro:bit with
# your fingers should increase the temperature
# a few degrees (to test the temp_regulate
# function).
#
# For the purposes of testing, current
# temperature readings are scrolled while button_b
# is pressed, and 'Hot!' followed by a temperature
# reading indicates that the prescribed temperature
# range has been exceeded. This is to provide
# feedback while testing.

# In-line comments indicate pseudo/remaining work,
# with remaining work labelled "CODE:".
